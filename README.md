# Roadmap

## Basics
- what is a program? (principles of programming, the entrypoint)
- prompt on consoles (hello world)
- variables (change the name of a greeted person, print a number)
- if statements/switch cases (greet according to gender -> Mr or Mrs)
- loops (greet multiple times)
- functions (generate the hello string)
- vectors (greeting a list of people)
- procedures (wrap the function and loop in a procedure greet)
- references

## Algorithms
- sort algorithm (quick sort, bubble sort)
- finding algorithms (linear search, dichotomic search)
- recursion ()

## OOP 
TODO

## Interesting to talk about someday
- regexes

## final project
some rpg like heathbound (TBD)
